# Summary

This is a remix of ToXIc's version of the X axis belt tensioner.  In this remixed version, the main piece fits better in the newer injection molded x carriage.  The original was too big... so much that I had to sand quite a bit to get it to fit, and it was still tight.  The bolts on the original version also did not fit well, and I had to scale them up 4% to get them to work.  In this remixed version, the bolts fit and work as they should as long as your printer is well tuned.  I printed the main piece with 25% infil and the bolts with 50% infil, no supports on either.
