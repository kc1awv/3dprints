# Summary

This is a modification of c_wolsey's Anet A8 Electronics Case that replaces the relay mount with a MOSFET mount, while maintaining compatibility with everything else. It includes a .f3d (Fusion 360) and .STEP file so you can make your own modifications as well. It fits a Raspberry Pi 3 or 2 but I'm not sure about the Pi 1. If you're worried, double check the dimensions.

# Print Settings

Printer: MendelMax 3
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 30%, Hexagonal

Notes: 
Printed with fans at 60%, 0.4mm nozzle diameter, and with PLA. It took about 12 hours at 90mm/s inside perimeters and infill speeds, and 72mm/s outside perimeter speeds. Used 2 perimeters and 4 solid layers on the top and bottom. Retraction was used with 1mm Z lift, 1mm retraction length, and wipe enabled. Print came out flawlessly.
