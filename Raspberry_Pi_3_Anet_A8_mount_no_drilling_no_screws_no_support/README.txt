# Summary

**Why?**

I've tried to come up with a solution to mount my Raspberry Pi 3 (for running OctoPrint) to the Anet A8 without the need to drill holes into the printer's frame. And to make things a little more challenging, I tried to do so without the need for support material. :)

**The mount**

The parts themselves feel pretty flimsy and assembly is a bit tricky, but once everything's in place, the whole construction is actually quite solid.

I consider this mount beta (sort of): it works, but it definitely could be improved - feedback is welcome!

**Assembly**

- Start by sliding the longest **part #1** from the narrower top of the frame (mainboard side) towards the bottom with the "claws" pointing towards the print bed.
- Do the same for **part #2**, but don't push them all the way down yet!
- Slide **parts #3** between the crossbars (#1 and #2) and the printer frame (from the back) and make sure to push them into their slots.
- Push **part #1** and **part #2** down until everything fits tight.
- Clip the Raspberry Pi in place.
- Done. :)
