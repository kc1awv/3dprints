# Summary

I didn't like the fact that the model by Brogz007 made you remove parts from the original printer, and also wasn't compatible with my other modifications. This one is instead mounted a little bit behind using the last screw hole instead of the first, going 2.5 cm behind. I made sure that is follows the profile of the printer

EDIT: 
v1.1 - Fixed hole positions and outside border.
EDIT: 
v1.2 - Added a 4th hole to allow mounting the motor in any direction. 
EDIT:
Thanks to xand3r for fixing  some compatibility issues with the file
